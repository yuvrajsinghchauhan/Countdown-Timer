# Countdown-Timer
A countdown timer can be defined as a virtual clock that counts down from a certain date or number to indicate the end or beginning of an offer or event. 
While such timers were typically used on landing pages, they’ve now found their way to checkout pages, as well.
The main purpose of a countdown timer is to create a sense of urgency and give the feeling that “time is running out.” 
In addition to this, businesses also use countdown timers to count down to when a special discount or offer will become available. It can be used to generate curiosity and keep people interested and coming back.
